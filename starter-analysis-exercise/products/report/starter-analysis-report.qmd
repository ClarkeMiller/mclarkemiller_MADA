# Summary/Abstract
This project was entirely fabricated.  No actual data was collected.  No persons were interviewed and so no PII exists.  

The goal of this project is to examine the effects of smoking, drinking, and the age that persons began drinking on physical and health characteristics such as height and weight.  The detrimental effects of these habits have been observed to be especially profound for the inhabitants of the Innsmouth Community. Innsmouth Community College has experienced an increasing college-wide epidemic of health concerns among students putatively associated with excess smoking and drinking.  Therefore, the focus of this study in the Innsmouth Community and the students of Innsmouth Community College.  "Volunteers" were asked about their personal/health history regarding personal smoking and drinking habits.  The data was processed using R and R Studio.

Federal Oversight:  As the town of Innsmouth and the surrounding areas are considered federal reservations in perpetuity per the conditions set forth by the Innsmouth Federal Reservation Act of 1927.  Final approvals from the Department of the Interior must be obtained before any finished project can be implemented or data/result shared or published.

# Introduction 
Smoking and drinking habits in adolescents have been shown to affect physical, developmental, and health in succeeding years.  This study has been designed to examine the effects of smoking, drinking, and the age that persons began drinking on physical and health characteristics such as height and weight.  Innsmouth, a “bedroom community”/suburb in the greater Arkham Metropolitan Area (AMA) in Massachusetts, was selected for this research project by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.  Innsmouth Community College serves the Innsmouth Community and surrounding areas.  Data from the Arkham Health and Human-ish Services uncovered a spike in certain health issues that may be related to excess smoking/drinking and/or underage drinking among students of the college.  The goal of this study is to ascertain if the health issues are related to these activities or if they may be attributable some other cause such as genetic disease. 


## General Background Information
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla congue vestibulum lorem in maximus. Pellentesque fermentum, elit in venenatis congue, sem sapien bibendum tellus, nec bibendum diam dui sit amet enim. Quisque sed laoreet elit. Donec feugiat tellus nec malesuada aliquam. Nam eu mi sed magna efficitur tempor. Ut vitae sagittis massa. Nunc eget iaculis nisl. Aenean rutrum vestibulum aliquam.

## Description of data and data source
Curabitur consequat auctor blandit. Mauris et imperdiet est. Morbi eget viverra nisl, sit amet ultricies sapien. Nulla sit amet tortor aliquam, blandit tellus vitae, aliquet massa. Fusce erat leo, commodo a diam ac, porttitor mollis purus. Sed tristique gravida elementum. Maecenas quis leo bibendum, rhoncus ex vel, cursus ipsum. Ut libero felis, euismod ultrices eros sit amet, consectetur suscipit lacus. Vivamus mauris metus, tempus nec vulputate sed, posuere placerat neque. Curabitur vehicula sagittis felis. Vestibulum maximus enim in orci vulputate rutrum.

## Questions/Hypotheses to be addressed
_State the research questions you plan to answer with this analysis._

To cite other work (important everywhere, but likely happens first in introduction), make sure your references are in the bibtex file specified in the YAML header above (here `dataanalysis_template_references.bib`) and have the right bibtex key. Then you can include like this:

Examples of reproducible research projects can for instance be found in [@mckay2020; @mckay2020a]

# Methods 

_Describe your methods. That should describe the data, the cleaning processes, and the analysis approaches. You might want to provide a shorter description here and all the details in the supplement._


## Data aquisition
_As applicable, explain where and how you got the data. If you directly import the data from an online source, you can combine this section with the next._


## Data import and cleaning
_Write code that reads in the file and cleans it so it's ready for analysis. Since this will be fairly long code for most datasets, it might be a good idea to have it in one or several R scripts. If that is the case, explain here briefly what kind of cleaning/processing you do, and provide more details and well documented code somewhere (e.g. as supplement in a paper). All materials, including files that contain code, should be commented well so everyone can follow along._


## Statistical analysis
_Explain anything related to your statistical analyses._

# Results

## Exploratory/Descriptive analysis

_Use a combination of text/tables/figures to explore and describe your data. Show the most important descriptive results here. Additional ones should go in the supplement. Even more can be in the R and Quarto files that are part of your project._


@tbl-summarytable shows a summary of the data.

Note the loading of the data providing a **relative** path using the `../../` notation. (Two dots means a folder up). You never want to specify an **absolute** path like `C:\ahandel\myproject\results\` because if you share this with someone, it won't work for them since they don't have that path. You can also use the `here` R package to create paths. See examples of that below. **I recommend the `here` package, but I'm showing the other approach here just in case you encounter it.**

```{r}
#| label: tbl-summarytable
#| tbl-cap: "Data summary table."
#| echo: FALSE
resulttable=readRDS("../../results/tables-files/summarytable.rds")
knitr::kable(resulttable)
```



## Basic statistical analysis

_To get some further insight into your data, if reasonable you could compute simple statistics (e.g. simple models with 1 predictor) to look for associations between your outcome(s) and each individual predictor variable. Though note that unless you pre-specified the outcome and main exposure, any "p<0.05 means statistical significance" interpretation is not valid._


@fig-result shows a scatterplot figure produced by one of the R scripts.

```{r}
#| label: fig-result
#| fig-cap: "Height and weight stratified by gender."
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("starter-analysis-exercise","results","figures","height-weight-stratified.png"))
```


## Full analysis

_Use one or several suitable statistical/machine learning methods to analyze your data and to produce meaningful figures, tables, etc. This might again be code that is best placed in one or several separate R scripts that need to be well documented. You want the code to produce figures and data ready for display as tables, and save those. Then you load them here._

Example @tbl-resulttable2 shows a summary of a linear model fit.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-resulttable2
#| tbl-cap: "Linear model fit table."
#| echo: FALSE
resulttable2 = readRDS(here("starter-analysis-exercise","results","tables-files","resulttable2.rds"))
knitr::kable(resulttable2)
```

# Discussion

## Summary and Interpretation
_Summarize what you did, what you found and what it means._

## Strengths and Limitations
_Discuss what you perceive as strengths and limitations of your analysis._

## Conclusions
_What are the main take-home messages?_

_Include citations in your Rmd file using bibtex, the list of references will automatically be placed at the end_

This paper [@leek2015] discusses types of analyses. 

These papers [@mckay2020; @mckay2020a] are good examples of papers published using a fully reproducible setup similar to the one shown in this template. 

Note that this cited reference will show up at the end of the document, the reference formatting is determined by the CSL file specified in the YAML header. Many more style files for almost any journal [are available](https://www.zotero.org/styles). You also specify the location of your bibtex reference file in the YAML. You can call your reference file anything you like, I just used the generic word `references.bib` but giving it a more descriptive name is probably better.
